<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84654095/173226180-8cfc91aa-63b0-4b67-a365-6ace75e02031.png)

Made with React and Reques API makes and API call to for the users list which is displayed in form of buttons and as the different users are fetched, you can choose from the available users to see their info and get their data.
The following code base can be used to for profile pages purpose or to display a particular team details

Here's why:
* Your teammates are very important part of your team and this makes sure that their info is displayed correctly
* A unique stylized way to display info which will obviously become more detailed as more data gets added onto each team mate.
* Your team mates should be rest assured that they are being represented by their team correctly :smile:

Ofcourse this code base is at a very nascent stage right now and I believe it can refined and made to add more exciting features and many more things.
